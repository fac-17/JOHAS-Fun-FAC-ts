## What we learnt 📖

## What's Gone Well 🤗

- Setting a sensible MVP that we were able to acheive
- Communication and splitting of tasks
- Swapping teams regularly and all working on different parts of the code base
- Adding in nice animation background

## What Could have Gone Better 😔

- Could have more testing
- Doing animation background ourselves instead of copy-pasting
